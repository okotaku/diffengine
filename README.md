## 📖 Introduction [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

DiffEngine is the open-source toolbox for training state-of-the-art Diffusion Models. Packed with advanced features including diffusers and MMEngine, DiffEngine empowers both seasoned experts and newcomers in the field to efficiently create and enhance diffusion models. Stay at the forefront of innovation with our cutting-edge platform, accelerating your journey in Diffusion Models training.

1. **Training state-of-the-art Diffusion Models**: Empower your projects with state-of-the-art Diffusion Models. We can use Stable Diffusion, Stable Diffusion XL, DreamBooth, LoRA etc.
2. **Unified Config System and Module Designs**: Thanks to MMEngine, our platform boasts a unified configuration system and modular designs that streamline your workflow. Easily customize hyperparameters, loss functions, and other crucial settings while maintaining a structured and organized project environment.
3. **Inference with diffusers.pipeline**: Seamlessly transition from training to real-world application using the diffusers.pipeline module. Effortlessly deploy your trained Diffusion Models for inference tasks, enabling quick and efficient decision-making based on the insights derived from your models.

## 🛠️ Installation [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

Before installing DiffEngine, please ensure that PyTorch has been successfully installed following the [official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Install DiffEngine

```
pip install openmim
pip install git+https://github.com/okotaku/diffengine.git
```

## 👨‍🏫 Get Started [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

DiffEngine makes training easy through its pre-defined configs. These configs provide a streamlined way to start your training process. Here's how you can get started using one of the pre-defined configs:

1. **Choose a config**: You can find various pre-defined configs in the [`configs`](configs/) directory of the DiffEngine repository. For example, if you wish to train a DreamBooth model using the Stable Diffusion algorithm, you can use the [`configs/stable_diffusion_dreambooth/stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog.py`](configs/stable_diffusion_dreambooth/stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog.py).

2. **Start Training**: Open a terminal and run the following command to start training with the selected config:

```bash
mim train diffengine stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog.py
```

3. **Monitor Progress and get results**: The training process will begin, and you can track its progress. The outputs of the training will be located in the `work_dirs/stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog` directory, specifically when using the `stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog` config.

```
work_dirs/stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog
├── 20230802_033741
|   ├── 20230802_033741.log  # log file
|   └── vis_data
|         ├── 20230802_033741.json  # log json file
|         ├── config.py  # config file for each experiment
|         └── vis_image  # visualized image from each step
├── step999
|   └── pytorch_lora_weights.bin  # weight for inferencing with diffusers.pipeline
├── iter_1000.pth  # checkpoint from each step
├── last_checkpoint  # last checkpoint, it can be used for resuming
└── stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog.py  # latest config file
```

An illustrative output example is provided below:

4. **Inference with diffusers.pipeline**: Once you have trained a model, simply specify the path to the saved model and inference by the `diffusers.pipeline` module.

```py
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

checkpoint = 'work_dirs/stable_diffusion_v15_dreambooth_lora_dog/step999'
prompt = 'A photo of sks dog in a bucket'

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    'runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5', torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.to('cuda')
pipe.load_lora_weights(checkpoint)

image = pipe(
    prompt,
    num_inference_steps=50,
).images[0]
image.save('demo.png')
```

## 🖋 Example Notebook [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
